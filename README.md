# Omni-Agoras-Balance-Tracking-Dashboard-

Dashboard Live version on: http://144.91.121.7:8081/

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a dashboard that monitors the balances of Agoras Tokens (AGRS) on the Omni layer. The key features of this dashboard include tracking the latest balances of individual addresses (updated daily), alerting on balance variations, and illustrating balance trends over specified periods.

Currently, the existing AGRS tokens function as placeholders, built on the ERC-20 token standard. However, there are valid tokens based on the older Omni Layer protocol, which are challenging to monitor due to lack of effective visualization tools. This dashboard aims to address that.

### Brief on Agoras Tokens (AGRS)
AGRS plays a pivotal role within the Tau product ecosystem, which encompasses Tau, Tau Net, and Tau Live. AGRS tokens can be exchanged for various products and services such as knowledge sharing, computational resources, and financial tools. These transactions are facilitated by contracts built on Tau technology, which enhances the use and liquidity of AGRS.

### Data Source:
OmniAPI (https://api.omniexplorer.info/, https://api.omniexplorer.info/ask.aspx?api=getpropertybalances&prop=58).

### Variables 
- Addresses: Unique identifiers for accounts on the Omni Layer.
- Balance: The net amount of tokens an address holds at any point in time.
- Reserves: Tokens held back by the project's team for specific purposes.

These variables help us understand the state of the Omni Layer, a protocol layered over the Bitcoin blockchain, which allows for custom digital asset creation and trading.
