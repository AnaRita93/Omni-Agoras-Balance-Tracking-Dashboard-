# Omni-Agoras-Balance-Tracking-Dashboard-

Dashboard Live version on: http://144.91.121.7:8081/

### Purpose of this Project
This project aims to develop a dashboard to monitor Omni Agoras Token balances in real-time. It tracks addresses by their latest balance (collected daily), notifies balance changes, and visualizes balance trends over time.

### What are Omni Agora Tokens?
Agoras Tokens (AGRS) are a cryptocurrency linked to the Tau Chain and Agoras projects. They're designed for a decentralized platform that allows for creating decentralized applications and new cryptocurrencies. Within this Tau platform, Agoras Tokens are the native currency, used for rewarding network contributors.

### Data Source:
OmniAPI (https://api.omniexplorer.info/, https://api.omniexplorer.info/ask.aspx?api=getpropertybalances&prop=58).

### Variables 
- Addresses: Unique identifiers for accounts on the Omni Layer.
- Balance: The net amount of tokens an address holds at any point in time.
- Reserves: Tokens held back by the project's team for specific purposes.

These variables help us understand the state of the Omni Layer, a protocol layered over the Bitcoin blockchain, which allows for custom digital asset creation and trading.
